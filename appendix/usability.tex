\section{Notes}

Suggestions from participants that were implemented:

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep-0.5em
  \item{Remove hat color option if not selected in color wizard.}
  \item{Otherwise if selected have Hat as option number 1.}
  \item{Prevent completion of bib numbers being drawn to screen if face not drawn.}
  \item{Note that steps are not updating for the images (retains previous image's step).}
  \item{Color wizard missing in main menu.}
  \item{Reword `is image crowded' step to `foreground crowded'.}
  \item{Cancel the color wizard should take you back to the base class wizard in first tag mode.}
  \item{Spit out a JSON file per photo rather than one dump JSON.}
  \item{Save on navigate to prevent data loss.}
  \item{Add big "Foreground is Crowded" over image if crowded is true.}
  \item{Open class dialogs to the side (left of centre)---that way we can see the runner.}
  \item{Add missing shortcut to delete runner.}
  \item{When going back an image, ask if you are finished tagging that image.}
  \item{Ask if image is crowded after 1.5 second delay---that way we can see the runner.}
  \item{Update bib number to be set in face mode (instruction text).}
  \item{Once tagged a person, automatically move to next person (in face mode).}

  \textbf{Question}                                                                            & \textbf{P1} & \textbf{P2} & \textbf{P3} \\ \midrule
  1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently                                   & 4           & 4           & 4           \\
  2. I found the system unnecessarily complex                                                  & 2           & 2           & 1           \\
  3. I thought the system was easy to use                                                      & 4           & 4           & 5           \\
  4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system & 1           & 1           & 1           \\
  5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated                         & 5           & 4           & 5           \\
  6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system                                 & 1           & 1           & 2           \\
  7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly              & 5           & 4           & 4           \\
  8. I found the system very cumbersome to use                                                 & 2           & 1           & 1           \\
  9. I felt very confident using the system                                                    & 5           & 4           & 4           \\
  10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system              & 1           & 1           & 1           \\ \midrule
