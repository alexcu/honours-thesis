I thank everyone at DSTIL for fostering a highly supportive and motivating environment to work in: you make every day enjoyable and are all my second family. I especially thank Simon Vajda and Rodney Pilgrim for their direction throughout my honours year, the exceptional research guidance provided by Raj Vasa and Nicola Pastorello as well as for our fruitful discussions and well-valued feedback on this thesis, and Jake Renzella for his much-needed support and friendship throughout the last two years. I also thank Andrew Cain for his extraordinary efforts over many years to teach thousands of students (myself included) and with whom I have developed a highly-valued mentorship with in guiding me throughout life. And lastly, I thank my loving and patient partner Tom Fellowes, without whom this thesis (indeed this year) would not be possible.
