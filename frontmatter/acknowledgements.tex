I thank everyone at DSTIL for fostering a highly supportive and motivating environment to work in: you make every day enjoyable and are all my second family. I especially thank Simon Vajda and Rodney Pilgrim for their direction throughout my honours year, the exceptional research guidance provided by Raj Vasa, Nicola Pastorello and Luis Torres and their fruitful discussions with me on my work and well-valued feedback on this thesis, and Jake Renzella and Reuben Wilson for their much-needed support and friendship throughout the last two years. I also strongly thank Andrew Cain for his extraordinary teaching efforts over many years, inspiring thousands of students to love the art of programming (myself included) and with whom I have developed a highly-valued mentorship with in guiding me throughout life. And lastly, I thank my loving and patient partner Tom Fellowes, without whom this thesis (indeed this year) would not be possible.
