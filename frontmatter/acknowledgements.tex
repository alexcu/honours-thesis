I thank everyone at DSTIL for fostering a highly supportive and motivating environment to work in: you make every day enjoyable and are all my second family. Because of you, I have developed a love of research that no one can take from me. I especially express my gratitude toward Simon Vajda and Rodney Pilgrim for their direction throughout my honours year; the exceptional research guidance from Raj Vasa and Nicola Pastorello, including our fruitful discussions and their well-valued feedback on this thesis; the extraordinary assistance provided by the entire DS/R team at DSTIL; and Jake Renzella and Reuben Wilson for their much-needed personal support and friendship since our undergraduate years at Swinburne, as well as the increasing number of coffees shared at Fusion as the submission date drew nearer! I am also infinitely indebted to Andrew Cain for his remarkable teaching efforts over many years, inspiring thousands of students to cherish the art of programming (myself included) and with whom I have developed a highly-valued mentorship to guide me throughout life. And lastly, I thank my loving family and partner Tom Fellowes, without whom this thesis---indeed this year---would not have been possible.
