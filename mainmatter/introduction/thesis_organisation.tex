\label{sec:introduction:organisation}

This thesis is organised into the chapters as outlined below. An appendix follows with additional supplementary material.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:background} - Background} Provides an overview of prior studies broadly around the areas of number detection and recognition in image processing and artificial \glspl{nn}.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:dataset} - Dataset} Describes the dataset to be used, data treatment steps, possible techniques in closer depth to develop a number recognition pipeline, and explores ways to develop a metamodel of gathering large datasets.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:processing_pipeline} - Processing Pipeline} Discusses the proposed processing pipeline developed that satisfies the aims of this study.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:evaluation_strategies} - Evaluation Strategies} Discusses several evaluation strategies used to assess the accuracy of our processing pipeline.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:findings} - Findings} Outlines the method used for validation and presentation of our results and compares this amongst existing open source tools and pipelines presented in previous work.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:discussion} - Discussion} Presents implications that were found from the results of our findings and limitations.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:conclusion} - Conclusions and Future Work} Draws a number of conclusions and alleviates gaps in the findings of this work by presenting future studies.
