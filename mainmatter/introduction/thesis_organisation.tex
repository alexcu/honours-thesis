\paragraph{Chapter \ref{ch:data_set} - Data Set} Describes the data set to be used, data treatment steps, possible techniques in closer depth to develop a number recognition pipeline, and explores ways to develop prominence ranking techniques.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{ch:benchmarking} - Benchmarking} Collates results of a series of experiments using our dataset amongst existing open source tools and pipelines presented in previous work

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{ch:processing_pipeline} - Processing Pipeline} Discusses the proposed processing pipeline developed that satisfies the aims of this study.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{ch:findings} - Findings} Outlines the method used for validation and presentation of our results.

\paragraph{Chapter \ref{ch:discussion} - Discussion} Presents implications that were found from the results of our findings and limitations.
