\section{Thesis Organisation}
\label{sec:introduction:organisation}

This thesis is organised into the chapters as outlined below. An appendix follows with additional supplementary material.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:background} - Background} Provides an overview of prior studies broadly around the areas of number detection and recognition in image processing and artificial \glspl{nn}.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:dataset} - Dataset} Describes the dataset to be used, data treatment steps, and possible techniques to develop a number recognition pipeline in closer depth. Furthermore, we explore ways to develop a metamodel to gather large, annotated datasets.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:argus} - Argus} Describes an implementation of our metamodel for the purposes of curating a training dataset in the context of marathon running photography.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:processing_pipeline} - Processing Pipeline} Discusses the proposed processing pipeline developed that satisfies the aims of this study.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:evaluation} - Evaluation} Discusses several evaluation strategies used to assess the accuracy of our processing pipeline, and presents the implications and limitations found from the results of our findings.

\paragraph{\cref{ch:conclusion} - Conclusions} Draws several conclusions and alleviates gaps in the findings of this work by proposing future studies.
