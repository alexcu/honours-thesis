\section{Background}
\label{sec:introduction:background}

This study focuses on character recognition in unstructured scenes (Figure~\ref{fig:sample_rbns}): specifically, short, alphanumeric number sequences. Previous works present methods to extract these sequences in various areas, namely: License Plate Recognition (LPR\newacronym{lpr}{LPR}{Licence Plate Recognition}) systems \citep{CanoPerez:2003fq,Anagnostopoulos:2006wv}; Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR\newacronym{tsr}{TSR}{Traffic Sign Recognition}) \citep{Eichner:2008dw,Kundu:2015vq,Seo:2015ez,Lian:2016dc}; and, street number recognition, specifically a study by \citet{Netzer:2011to}, using Google Street View\footnoteurl{https://www.google.com/streetview/}{13 May 2017} to determine the numerical value of street numbers. Figure~\ref{fig:sample_sequences} highlights typical usage of these sequences.

Different applications apply varying methods to parse short alphanumeric characters. There are typically two stages of any parsing method: \textit{detection} and \textit{recognition}. Detection refers to locating possible candidates and recognition refers to the representation of the text itself. Detection techniques usually are categorised as either connected component (CC)\newacronym{cc}{CC}{Connected Component}-based or learning or texture-based. CC-based detection will typically use a set of distinct properties on the image to detect relevant areas (such as width, stroke and colour) while learning-based feed images into a classifier that can distinguish candidates from false positives. The recognition phase can typically be achieved using optical image recognition OCR engines (such as Tesseract\footnoteurl{https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract}{14 May 2017}), machine learning algorithms or deep neural networks (NNs\newacronym{nn}{NN}{Neural Network}) to classify the detected regions. % TODO: Find citation

  This study proposes the development of a learning-based detection and recognition pipeline using deep-learning neural networks within the context of unstructured photos, with a focus on marathon Racing Bib Numbers (RBNs)\newacronym{rbn}{RBN}{Racing Bib Number}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sample_rbns}.
