\section{Research Goals}
\label{sec:research_goals}

This study aims to develop a processing pipeline that both detects and recognises RBNs on a marathon runner, and then ranks the prominence of each runner detected in the photo. Using artificial deep-learning neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks or CNNs\newacronym{cnn}{CNN}{Convolutional Neural Network}) in this pipeline is the main objective, unlike previous studies in RBN recognition that were heavily heuristic and rule driven. This primary aim is developed into three key objectives:

%By working with a large labelled dataset in the context of RBN recognition, a benchmark between existing libraries and open source tools can be assessed using techniques developed in other related works. A collated literature review of the state of the art in image processing and image segmentation from other similar areas (such as speed limit sign detection) is to be conducted. The study will also attempt to train a neural network to recognise entire numbers in an RBN, rather than segmented numbers joined together.

%When compared to the wider context of alphanumeric text recognition, this study focuses solely in the area of RBN detection. A generalised approach may be evolved from the study, such as applying the pipeline to other subjects or moving images (such as parked cars).
