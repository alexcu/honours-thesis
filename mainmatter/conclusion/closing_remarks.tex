\section{Closing Remarks}

In his \citeyear{Schwab:2017vd} book, \citet{Schwab:2017vd}, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, comments on the impact on human society with the impending fourth industrial revolution, coined Industry 4.0 by \citet{kagermann2011industrie}. Schwab discusses that such a revolution will fundamentally be underpinned by \glsx{ai} systems. Thus, improvements in object detection, prominence ranking, and alphanumeric sequence recognition are just a slice of how the impact of automation may lessen the need for humanity to rely on heuristic-driven systems.

% General wrap-up
\bigskip
\noindent
We anticipate that this thesis encompasses the body of how \gls{ai} systems, like the pipeline developed within this work, show that we are only at the beginning for what is soon to come.
