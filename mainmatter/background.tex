\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}


We have introduced the context of image processing and neural networks in the field, and discussed how text capturing within photos is typically achieved in two stages: detection and recognition. Detection techniques are classified as either \gls{cc}- or learning-based. The recognition phase uses traditional \gls{ocr} engines or, more recently, using artificial \glspl{nn}. 

In this chapter, we survey a number of broad applications where \gls{rbn} recognition (and related works) are investigated using such phases. Various detection and recognition techniques discussed in literature are also detailed. We broadly define previous applications of artificial deep-learning \glspl{nn} in these contexts.

\section*{Summary}

In this chapter, we have surveyed a range of literature in various application contexts: \gls{rbn} and \gls{tsr} recognition, recognition of alphanumeric sequences `in the wild', and additionally object instance segmentation. We have also investigated the varied range of techniques used to both detect and recognise the text, using both heuristic-based and \gls{nn}-based approaches. Our following chapter will discusses a means to capture data for the purposes of training a deep-learning \gls{nn}.
