\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}


We have introduced the context of image processing and neural networks in the related field, and discussed how text capturing within photos is typically achieved in two stages: detection and recognition. Detection techniques are classified as either \gls{cc}- or learning-based. The recognition phase uses traditional \gls{ocr} engines or, more recently, using artificial \glspl{nn}. 

This chapter surveys a number of broad applications where RBN recognition (and related works) are investigated using such phases. The various detection and recognition techniques discussed in the literature are also detailed. We also broadly define previous applications of artificial deep-learning \gls{nn} in these contexts, and ways in which datasets can be procured for training.
