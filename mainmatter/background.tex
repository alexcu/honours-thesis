\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}


We have introduced the context of image processing and neural networks in the related field, and discussed how text capturing within photos is typically achieved in two stages: detection and recognition. Detection techniques are generally classified as either CC- or learning-based. The recognition phases can be applied using traditional OCR engines or, more recently, using artificial NNs. This chapter surveys a number of broad applications where RBN recognition (and related works) are investigated using such phases. The various detection and recognition techniques discussed in the literature are also detailed. We also broadly define the applications of artificial deep-learning NNs in these contexts.
