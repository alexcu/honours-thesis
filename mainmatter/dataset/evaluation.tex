\section{Metamodel Evaluation}
\label{sec:dataset:metamodel_evaluation}

In this section, we evaluate our metamodel against other datasets with similar annotations, and heuristically assess it. Additionally, we propose areas where the metamodel could be improved, and highlight comparative systems to Argus.

\subsection{Dataset Annotations}
\label{sec:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:annotations}

We analysed seven popular datasets in either text extraction or object recognition and assessed their annotation format to determine the heuristic overlap between the dataset's annotation model and our metamodel. An overview of the datasets, annotation formats and capturing software is shown in Table~\ref{tab:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:datasets}. We summarise our analysis of directly mapping components from these formats within the \gls{adf} in Table~\ref{tab:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:mappings}.

For each of these datasets, the annotation capturing strategies differed and, similarly, the annotation encoding was either encoded as a binary MATLAB\footnote{MATLAB is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc.} file or serialised in plain text (either as \gls{xml} or \glsac{json}). In the case where annotations were serialised in \gls{xml}, a popular format was the \glsac{pascal}\footnote{\gls{pascal}}-\gls{voc} \citep{Everingham:2009dq} format. This format was made popular with the various \glsac{pascal} \gls{voc} Challenges \citep{Everingham:2015tv,Everingham:2010wz,Everingham:2005vr,Everingham:2009dq}, though custom annotation formats in \gls{xml} are also present (e.g., \gls{icdar}).

\paragraph{MS \glsac{coco} and \glsac{coco}-Text \glsac{json} Format}

The Microsoft \gls{coco} \citep{Lin:2014vma} dataset and its image captions extension \citep{Chen:2015ur} require all annotations to be labelled to one of 91 specified categories. This is done using a three-step annotation pipeline consisting of: (1) labelling all categories of objects in the image, (2) spotting all instances of these characters, and (3) segmenting the instances using a polygon. For our analysis, we focus only on the Object Keypoint and Image Caption Annotation challenges.

We mapped the annotation concepts from both MS \gls{coco} (and its text-reading equivalent \gls{coco}-Text) and mapped components to the \gls{adf}. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:mapping:coco}, these high-level components are largely complete when expressed in \gls{adf}, and the mapping is powerful enough to compute required components of the \gls{coco}-based annotation formats to implicit calculations within \gls{adf}.

Our metamodel did not consider using \gls{rle} to encode multiple boundaries (polygons), as is used when \textit{Is Crowd} is set to 1 to indicate multiple instances in the image. However, we still capture this under the a form of a \textit{Boundary}. Additionally, we found that the \textit{Is Crowd} is the only mapping of all the formats that relates to an \gls{adf} \textit{Image-Level Feature}.


\paragraph{\gls{pascal} \gls{voc} \gls{xml}}

The \gls{pascal} \gls{voc} \gls{xml} format showed the most consistency with \gls{adf}'s variant \textit{Annotation} sub-types (Figure~\ref{fig:metamodel_class_diagrams:feature}), along with the \gls{icdar} \gls{xml} format. The \gls{pascal} \gls{voc} format shows direct mappings to our components, such as \textit{Bounding Box} to an \textit{Annotation}'s equivalent, \textit{Boundary}. Additionally, a collection of \textit{Action}s (as given in the 2012 format to extend the \textit{Pose} of a person feature) can be used as a list of variant \textit{Category} annotations. Further mappings can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:mapping:pascal}.

\paragraph{\gls{icdar} \gls{xml} Format}

The two \gls{icdar} datasets (including the 2011 update) can also be captured within an \gls{adf}. We present this mapping in Figure~\ref{fig:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:mapping:icdar}. Most notably, we map the \textit{Text Line}, \textit{Word}, \textit{Atom} and \textit{Text Parts} as \gls{adf} \textit{Collection}s. The \textit{Don't Care} component is a flag to notify if a line is illegible, which we can indicate using a \textit{Boolean} annotation (a \textit{Category}). The explicit \textit{Color} type in the \gls{icdar} 2011--2015 format can also be mapped to a \textit{Label} (more specifically, the \textit{Colour} label).

\paragraph{MATLAB Binaries}

To investigate the mapping of variant MATLAB binaries, we inspected the relevant guides on how to read the cell-arrays for both the SynthText 90k\footnoteurl{http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/scenetext/readme.txt}{17 August 2017} and \gls{svhn}\footnoteurl{http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/\#downloads}{17 August 2017} datasets. Of the formats investigated, these were the simplest, and were the only ones to directly map an \textit{Explicit Attribute} (for Synth90k). These are shown in further detail within Figure~\ref{fig:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:mapping:matlab}.


\bigskip
\noindent
We have shown that our metamodel is largely consistent with four popular existing data formats, and therefore is largely complete to what previous annotation systems require. We propose that adapters can be used to map such formats, thereby unifying all datasets into one readable format which can be used for \gls{ai} training and validation. We leave this open for future work.

% Evaluate the meta model using a herustic overlap to check if our metamodel is complete. Do this against three existing and popular datasets: COCO text, ICDAR?, SVHN?. Check Scott's thesis on his eval strats to see if the metamodel is complete, consistsent and expressive enough against other parts of the meta model, and where we could potentially fill gaps.

\subsection{Comparative Annotation Tools}
\label{sec:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:tools}

In this section, we compare Argus to comparative annotation tools  and services used to annotate datasets.

\paragraph{LabelMe} 

LabelMe\footnoteurl{http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/}{17 August 2017} (Figure~\ref{}), developed by \citet{Russell:2008wm}, is a web-based application that requires annotators to set up on their own system. It has been successfully used to markup the large \gls{sun} dataset by novice users, though the developers did note a number of reflective fallbacks and potential difficulties using the tool \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1210-3448}. LabelMe does not contain a specific instructional workflow, unlike Argus, and therefore annotators are allowed to selectively choose whichever objects to annotate\footnote{Instructions are potentially vague: ``Use your mouse to click around the boundary of \textit{some} objects''.}. This makes the resulting dataset largely incomplete as (potentially) not all objects in each image are fully annotated. Additionally, there is no restriction to what types of objects are annotated in the image, as any text can be used to describe an object (rather from a hierarchical category, such as in \citep{Lin:2014vma}).

  \caption[The LabelMe user interface]{The LabelMe user interface \citep{Russell:2008wm}.}
  \label{}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{\glsac{apep}} 

\citet{Karatzas:2014bt} introduced the \glsac{cvc} \gls{apep}\footnoteurl{http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/}{17 August 2017}, made popular for use using the \gls{icdar} 2011--2015 Robust Reading Competitions. Unlike our system, users can edit the per-pixel boundaries using a `flood-fill' or `magic-select' markup tool (with an adjustable tolerance), followed by a skeletonisation of the boundaries filled. This speeds up selection of specific text areas quite useful (see Figure~\ref{}). While we did not incorporate a feature into Argus, a potential future version would benefit using such an annotation tool for a polygon, rather than clicking $n_{vertices}$ times if the vertices count is unknown. This could also be encoded using \gls{rle} as suggested from the \gls{coco} format in Section~\ref{sec:dataset:metamodel_evaluation:annotations}. Additionally, users are able to zoom into the photo to get finer accuracies at the pixel level.

% ICDAR12-15 which uses CVC Annotation and Performance Evaluation Platform (APEP) \cite{Karatzas:2015tj}

\paragraph{\glsac{amt}}

\gls{amt}\footnoteurl{https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome}{11 August 2017} provides \gls{saas} that does not require downloading or setting up (typically laborious for annotators). Annotation is achieved in the form of customised \glspl{hit}, using a custom interface. Recently, this is typically the most popular choice of annotation outsourcing \citep{Lin:2014vma,Veit:2016vj,Chen:2015ur,JiaDeng:2009dl,Netzer:2011to} due to flexibility in developing customised interfaces for the task at hand, though the benefits of ensuring a user-friendly crowdsourcing annotation system are presented by \citet{Matera:2014wq}. \citet{Sorokin:2008uk} discuss the utility of using \gls{amt} for annotation.

\paragraph{\glsdisp{vatic}{VATIC}}

\glsdisp{vatic}{VATIC (the \glsdesc{vatic})} is a a free web-based product developed by \citet{springerlink:10.1007/s11263-012-0564-1}, running on \gls{amt}. We note this tool specifically for the use of annotating video stills within an image: its intended purpose is for the sole use of object tracking in videos. There are only three annotations per object: the object name, the object is out of view, and the object is obstructed. It is useful in that not all frames have to be individually annotated, as the tool uses object tracking to estimate the movement between every 2-3 seconds. This may be useful to incorporate into future works of Argus.

\paragraph{ScaleAPI}

ScaleAPI\footnoteurl{http://www.scaleapi.com}{11 August 2017} is a recent \gls{saas} that provides a web-based \gls{api} to return human-marked annotation in realtime. Various boundary annotations can be made on an image. Listings~\ref{lst:dataset:evaluation:scaleapi:req} and \ref{lst:dataset:evaluation:scaleapi:res} show the request and response for a simple instruction to draw bounding boxes around all pedestrians and cars in the image\footnoteurl{https://docs.scaleapi.com/?shell\#bounding-box-annotation}{17 August 2017}. Additionally, object segmentation (on a per-pixel basis). While there is no need for workflows in a single request (as multiple requests can be made for multiple workflow steps), instructions to annotators are provided on a per-request basis. Furthermore, ScaleAPI allows for categorisation and comparison tasks, data collection, \gls{ocr} and audio transcription.
