\section{A Data-Capturing Architecture}
\label{sec:dataset:architecture}

Why should we care about the architecture of our dataset capturing, so long as the \gls{ai} is well-trained? This question fundamentally leads to the \textit{provenance} or \textit{lineage} of our data: not all training data is initially perfect. At times, we will need to modify our training data, or in the cases of some \gls{ai} systems, training data is re-fed back into the system from the \gls{ai} itself. 

Hence, it is imperative to understand how the transition and flow of data occurs \citep{Cui:2003im,Ikeda:2009ca,Buneman:2000bn} in these \gls{ai} systems. Where does it comes from? How is it derived and updated, and how might this affect our trained \gls{ai} models over time? A lack of understanding in training data provenance for large-scale \glspl{ai} implies difficulty in sourcing the cause of errors due to these mutations. It may be a difference in the data training format, or a mismatch of values on the same training data. Overcoming this without systematic record-keeping is challenging.

We therefore propose a grammar to describe systematic approach of a data-capturing architecture. As such a grammar is textual, it can be version controlled: therefore data provenance is recorded, which allows us to source how the mutations in training data can occur and and what effect this has our \gls{ai} systems. From an exploratory analysis of developing this architecture (Section~\ref{sec:dataset:architecture:methodology}), we propose a theoretical and generalisable metamodel that can be used to capture any form image data for training purposes (e.g., frames of a video, images of natural scenes). This metamodel is largely inspired by the works of \citet{Wickham:2010hy, Wickham:2007tu} and \citet{Moody:2009vo}.
