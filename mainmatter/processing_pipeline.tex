\chapter{Processing Pipeline}
\label{ch:processing_pipeline}

\cref{ch:dataset,ch:argus} discuss methods to curate and augment datasets. Using these datasets, we train a \gls{nn} to develop a processing pipeline. This chapter describes this process and how we developed our pipeline to detect bib sheets `in-the-wild' on any given marathon photo. Lastly, we explain our method of \gls{ocr} to convert our \gls{rbn} candidates into text.  An overview of our pipeline is shown in \cref{fig:processing_pipeline:pipeline} and the source code is made available online\footnoteurl{http://github.com/alexcu/hermes-bib-detect}{25 September 2017}.

\section{Summary}

This chapter presents an end-to-end pipeline that solely uses \glspl{nn} for object detection and text recognition to find the \glspl{rbn} in a given marathon photo. We successfully utilise transfer-learning on \frcnn{} to train it to detect both bibs sheets and text regions within those bib sheets. To reduce background noise, we use the \gls{yolo} object detection system and only check for bib sheets on a given crop of a detected human's bounding box region. We evaluate this pipeline in the following chapter.

The primary contributions of this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item an end-to-end \gls{nn}-based pipeline to detect and recognise \glspl{rbn} in a natural scene, and
  \item a proposed method to increase accuracies by human extraction within photos.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Minor contributions in this chapter include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item evolvement in the area of object detection and transfer learning,
  \item a methodology for improving the results from an \gls{ocr} system given images without binarised text colours, and
  \item a methodology for removing false positive cases from an \gls{ocr} system.
\end{itemize}
