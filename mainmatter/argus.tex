\chapter{Argus}
\label{ch:argus}

Within this chapter, we present Argus\footnote{Inspired by the \textit{all-seeing} giant of the same name from Greek mythology: ``With his multiple sets of eyes, Argus could see nearly everything in his vicinity''. See \url{http://www.loggia.com/myth/argus.html}.}, a partial implementation of our metamodel. We discuss the overall design of Argus and how this fits into the workflow (as presented in \cref{sec:dataset:process}). Additionally, we briefly discuss productivity and performance statistics gathered during the data gathering process, and assess Argus against other comparative tools. Further information related to Argus can be found at \url{http://deakin.edu.au/~ca/argus}, and the source code for Argus is located at \url{http://github.com/alexcu/argus}.

\section*{Summary}

This chapter presents Argus, the implementation of our metamodel shown in \cref{ch:dataset}. We present the overall \gls{ui} in Argus, and evaluate it against three key metrics: throughput, bias and quality. We also present comparative annotation tools that we assess against Argus to find specific overlaps between both.
