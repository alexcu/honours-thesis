The unification of smartphones and cameras has sparked a plethora of applications in image processing from natural scenes. Motivated by information extraction from the unstructured data within a natural image, different applications have sought to process images via heuristics, as opposed to deep-learning \glsx{nn}, for the purposes of object detection. Potential issues begin to arise when researchers rely on heuristics: in our context of marathon runners, facial detection is a heuristic method used in conjunction with a predefined ratio to determine the torso area \citep{Benami:2012jf}. We have shown that this method is not always universal (\cref{fig:background:recognition:benami2012_missed}). In others---such as \glsx{lpr}---we find that distinct image properties (e.g., stroke, width and colour) are utilised, and thus as images become more complex, the performance is likely to degrade \citep{Li:2012wd}.
