Ever since the camera and phone were unified into smartphones, we have seen an increasing interest for image processing analysis, but text recognition still faces challenges within images of unstructured scenes. While successes in character recognition have long been developed and improved upon with Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\newacronym{ocr}{OCR}{Optical Character Recognition} engines \citep{Smith:1987tg}, these are typically applied under strict conditions (e.g., flatbed document scanners). Once applied within the context of a natural scene, real-world discrepancies pose serious shortcomings, such as illumination and viewpoint conditions, blur and glare variations, geometric and photometric distortion, and differences in font size and style. Overcoming these issues has motivated a variety of different proposed techniques in order to realise potential applications that make use of text recognition at scale. 

Dissect the practicality of image processing within natural scenes, along with the ubiquity of smartphone cameras, and potential applications become clearer. In the last two decades, we have seen the development of point-and-shoot product recognition \citep{Tsai:2010cn,Girod:2011gw}, object detection in videos \citep{Sivic:2003tj}, building recognition \citep{Takacs:2008cg}, image feature extraction to improve visual-based search engines \citep{Lowe:2004kp,Bay:2008ud}, and translation services of American Sign Language gestures \citep{Jin:2016jd}. Nonetheless, embedded text within images reveals the largest form of informative features about the image; if text extraction is therefore not robust, information extraction suffers.

Research in overcoming such limitations were competed in \citet{Lucas:2003iw}, where robustness was a key focus in the image processing pipelines proposed. This focus was reiterated by \citet{Chen:2011ul}, who state the primary prerequisite for text-based recognition (especially within natural scenes) is the text location must be robustly located. As with any data processing pipeline, false negatives increase where early stages of the pipeline fail. Detection of potential candidates must therefore be robust, and we can reduce cases of errors where we potentially include stages within a pipeline that could be warranted unnecessary, increasing the robustness by parsing unmatched candidates through further pipelines.

Robustness is therefore a key consideration made in our assessment of how useful that pipeline may be. Without the construct of robustness, we restrict these pipelines to very confined conditions, and its usefulness in products is not warranted.
