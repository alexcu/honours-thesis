Ever since the development of low-cost cameraphones, we have seen an increasing interest for image processing analysis, but text recognition still faces challenges within images of unstructured scenes. While successes in character recognition have long been developed and improved upon with Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\newacronym{ocr}{OCR}{Optical Character Recognition} engines \citep{Smith:1987tg}, these are typically applied under strict conditions. Once applied within the context of a natural scene, real-world discrepancies pose serious shortcomings, such as illumination and viewpoint conditions, blur and glare variations, geometric and photometric distortion, and differences in font size and style. Realising potential applications to overcome similar issues has motivated a variety of different proposed techniques. 

\citet{Chen:2011ul} develop a robust text detection on the fundamental principle that the text itself must be robustly located in the image. Similarly
